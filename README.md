# HexEmbedd_ASM
Bash script for assembly programming

This script acts like a crawler that goes through all the directories that are in the project and then builds the Release directory.

For step-by-step instructions follow this link:


To be able to use this script you will need to download first the next package:
 - sudo apt-get install nasm
 
Direct download command of the script: curl -o HexEmbedd_ASM.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kapucin28/HexEmbedd_ASM/master/HexEmbedd_ASM.sh                                           
IMPORTANT! Download or copy the file in the project directory, not somewhere else!

The .sh file will do the following:
 - compile asm files,
 - create the .lst file,
 - create the .o files,
 - create the executable file.
